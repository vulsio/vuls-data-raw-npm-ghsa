See [this issue](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/5261) for more details.\n\n# CVE description\n\n\"** DISPUTED ** A command injection vulnerability in Lodash 4.17.21 allows attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution via the template function. This is a different parameter, method, and version than CVE-2021-23337. NOTE: the vendor's position is that it's the developer's responsibility to ensure that a template does not evaluate code that originates from untrusted input.",
